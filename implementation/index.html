            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <div><b>RISK: About 3.2 billion people </b>– almost half of the world’s population – are at risk of malaria.<br>
                <b>CASES: 214 million</b> malaria cases reported worldwide in 2015.<br>
                <b>INCIDENCE: 37%</b> global decrease in malaria incidence between 2000 and 2015.<br>
                <b>MORTALITY: 60%</b> decrease in global malaria mortality rates between 2000 and 2015.<br>
                → "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the
                bites of
                infected female mosquitoes."<br>
                → "Young children, pregnant women and non-immune travellers from malaria-free areas are particularly
                vulnerable to the disease when they become infected."<br>
                → "Malaria is preventable and curable, and increased efforts are dramatically reducing the malaria
                burden in
                many places."
            </div>
            <h2>Malaria</h2>
            <div>Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes which
                bite
                between dusk and dawn. People infected with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness
                at
                first.
                Left untreated, the disease can lead to severe complications and, in some cases, death.
            </div>
            <h2>Malaria Parasites</h2>
            <div><b>Malaria in humans is caused by five species of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium.</b>
                Four of these – P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale – are human malaria species that are
                spread
                from one person to another via the bite of female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. There are about 400
                different species of Anopheles mosquitoes, but only 30 of these are vectors of major importance. In
                recent
                years, human cases of malaria due to P. knowlesi have been recorded – this species causes malaria among
                monkeys in certain forested areas of South-East Asia. Current information suggests that P. knowlesi
                malaria
                is
                not spread from person to person, but rather occurs in people when an Anopheles mosquito infected by a
                monkey then bites and infects humans (zoonotic transmission). P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most
                prevalent, and P. falciparum is the most dangerous, with the highest rates of complications and
                mortality.
                This
                deadly form of malaria is a serious public health concern in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
            </div>
            <h2>Malaria Cases</h2>
            <div><b>Malaria cases.</b> The number of malaria cases globally fell from an estimated 262 million in 2000
                (range: 205–
                316 million), to 214 million in 2015 (range: 149–303 million), a decline of 18%. Most cases in 2015 are
                estimated to have occurred in the WHO African Region (88%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region
                (10%) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%).<br>
                <b>Malaria deaths.</b> The number of malaria deaths globally fell from an estimated 839 000 in 2000
                (range:
                653
                000–1.1 million), to 438 000 in 2015 (range: 236 000–635 000), a decline of 48%. Most deaths in 2015
                were in
                the WHO African Region (90%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (7%) and the WHO Eastern
                Mediterranean Region (2%). The malaria mortality rate, which takes into account population growth, is
                estimated to have decreased by 60% globally between 2000 and 2015.
            </div>
            <h2>Progress</h2>
            <div><b>Progress to elimination.</b> An increasing number of countries are moving towards elimination of
                malaria.
                Whereas only 13 countries were estimated to have fewer than 1000 malaria cases in 2000, 33 countries are
                estimated to have achieved this milestone in 2015.<br>
                <b>Financing of malaria control programmes.</b> Global financing for malaria control increased from an
                estimated
                US$ 960 million in 2005 to US$ 2.5 billion in 2014.
            </div>
            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <div>To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global
                Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy
                provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and
                elimination.
                This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing malaria
                case
                incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in at
                least
                35
                countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free. To achieve these
                targets,
                annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period, from US$ 2.7 billion
                (current
                level of
                spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.
            </div>
            <h2>WHO recommendations</h2>
            <div>International travellers could be at risk of malaria infection in 97 countries around the world, mostly
                in
                Africa,
                Asia and the Americas.
                Prevention of mosquito bites between dusk and dawn is the first line of defence against malaria.
                Measures to
                prevent mosquito bites include sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets, and using protective
                clothing
                and
                insect repellents. Depending on the malaria risk in the area to be visited, international travellers may
                also need
                to take preventive medication (chemoprophylaxis) prior to, during, and upon return from their travel.
