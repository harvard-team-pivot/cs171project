Final Project collaboration site

This will be the process book location for our project

To begin with we put together the group expectations document.  We discussed needed roles and began creating a project plan.  Based on the roles and processes gleaned from the course, we added tasks to the project plan.  Next we started exploring which data sets we wanted to use.  After setting on the [World Bank](http://lpi.worldbank.org/) logistics data, we worked on which parts of it were most suitable for exploration.

We had decided that slack would be our primary communication method and created a private channel.  A github repository was added to an existing organization.  To separate our data from our presentation we created a second branch for our web site.

**Design Sketches**

Following the [five design methodology](fds.design), team members began creating [sketches](link to sketches) for discussion.

Filtering ideas

Map connected to stacked bar chart

Selection or Filtering would highlight country

ranking on bar chart of all countries

Tooltips-lower priority

Slider at bottom

Chloropleth map based on total score of country

Categorize

Questions

What's a given countries ability to trade?  With other countries?  Within region?  What direction is the country moving?

Elevator Pitch created and uploaded.  Video deck was done in powerpoint.  A single visualizations for the deck was created in OmniGraffle
depicting an overview of the steps involved in the logistics process.  Thinking of incorporating it into the final project as it could be
color coded to components.  We'll call it a stretch goal.


Screenflick was available to capture deck presentation with voiceover.  Uploaded it to youtube ->

Project plan iteration two included second generation sketches, interaction options and first draft of page functionality.
A weekly project timeline was also inserted.

Updated process book with todos for Poster Sessions and work breakdown scheduling requirements.

TODO:

Formalize timeline with feature level milestones

More concise webpage layout/storytelling

Find consensus in your team on which you think are the three most representative visualizations for your assigned field.

Take all your printouts and get together
in your expert groups and collect ideas
about your topic area.

1) Project-related Poster
- explain your project idea in a
compact way
- explain how the visualizations
would be included in your
vis design
2) Vis Exploration Poster
- give an overview of important
visualizations for your field
- explain each technique
-
Create a sketch of your poster on a
sheet of paper that represents your
teamâ€™s selection of methods.(4 visualizations) Abstract
your printouts by wireframes

Create your poster and use:
- title and authors
- proper alignment and whitespace (image caption)
- storytelling principles
