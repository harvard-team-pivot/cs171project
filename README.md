# cs171project

Final Project collaboration site

This will be the process book location for our project

To begin with we put together the group expectations document.  We discussed needed roles and began creating a project plan.  Based on the roles and processes gleaned from the course, we added tasks to the project plan.  Next we started exploring which data sets we wanted to use.  After setting on the [World Bank](http://lpi.worldbank.org/) logistics data, we worked on which parts of it were most suitable for exploration.

We had decided that slack would be our primary communication method and created a private channel.  A github repository was added to an existing organization.  To separate our data from our presentation we created a second branch for our web site.

** Design Sketches

Following the [five design methodology](fds.design), team members began creating [sketches](link to sketches) for discussion.
